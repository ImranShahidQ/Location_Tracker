This is my complete check-in/check-out location tracker web app. The frontend of this project is based on React.js, and the backend is based on PHP Laravel. The React.js part has used for view files, where I created the login, registration, check-in, check-out pages, and check-in/check-out history for each user. The Laravel backend part has used for API creation and saving data into the database, which comes from the frontend through APIs. Full validation is implemented in this project; only authenticated users can log in to the application. If a user tries to access the check-in/check-out page directly, they will be restricted and prompted to log in first.For location and map integration, I used openstreetmap api in this.
